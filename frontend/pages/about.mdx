# Story behind ReNFAs ‚ú®ü¶ß

Once upon a time, there was a legendary [collection](https://apeswap.finance/nft) for Apes, born out of [ApeSwap](https://twitter.com/ape_swap).


The other day, an annon shadow-super coder discovered this cool **NFA**(Non-fungible Apes) collection, and also figured out the actual images are stored off-chain, proudly hosted on the [GitHub playground](https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/non-fungible-apes/tree/main/images) in the web2 world üôà.


The annon dev decided to fix this - he called out the historic APEish times influenced by the [Loot project](https://www.lootproject.com/). So he decided to build the loot derivative for **NFA**, where each NFT image is stored on chain in the format of SVG. He wasn't good at naming things, but anyhow named the project as **"ReNFA"**.


The annon built the [smart contract](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xA20fbd8d87964f7c7008B3D3b3Df7D64bb5e4202#code) for the **ReNFA** yet on Binance smart chain, and the DApp UI for [minting](/mint) the ReNFA, and [previewing](/) the NFTs that a user owns.


Enjoy the project and fullfill your energy to help make **NFA** the best ape collection üíñ ü¶ç.
